[Flare](https://www.2dimensions.com/about-flare) offers powerful realtime vector design and animation for app and game designers alike. The primary goal of Flare is to allow designers to work directly with assets that run in their final product, eliminating the need to redo that work in code.

## Libraries
There are two Dart packages provided in this repository. [flare_dart](flare_dart) and [flare_flutter](flare_flutter). Most of the time you'll want only [flare_flutter](flare_flutter), especially if you're just starting out with Flare. Please read the details in [flare_flutter](flare_flutter) for how to get your Flare animations running in Flutter!
